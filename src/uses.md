![A clean white desk with a studio display, keyboard and trackpad. There's also a remarkable tablet, a pair of homepod minis and a large black water bottle. The sun is creeping through the shutters which adds a nice effect to the background.](https://andy-bell.imgix.net/2025/03/desk-2025.jpg)

## FAQ

### Did you tidy the desk for this shot? 

I did not. I might be [flexible in how I design and build websites](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), but I am extremely regimented when it comes to having a tidy workspace. 

### How come you don't use the software I like to use?

I like what I like! 

### One display?! 

Focus babey!
