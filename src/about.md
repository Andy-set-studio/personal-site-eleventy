Hi, I’m Andy Bell—a designer, front-end developer and [design agency founder](https://set.studio)—based in the UK. I have worked in the design and web industries for over 15 years, and in that time, I have worked with some of the largest organisations in the world, like Google, Harley-Davidson, BSkyB, Unilever, The Natural History Museum, Oracle, Capita, Vice Media and the NHS.

Over these years, I have worked on both extremely large projects for huge organisations and tiny projects for small startups. This has given me a lot of experience over a large variety of project types. It also means I’ve worked with a lot of teams in various sizes—each with their own constraints and goals. These projects vary between design systems, creative campaign work and good ol’ websites.

I mostly specialise in CSS—whether that is writing a [course for Google](https://web.dev/learn/css/), co-authoring a [book on CSS layout](https://every-layout.dev/), or creating a [methodology to help people write better CSS](https://cube.fyi/). A big chunk of [our](https://set.studio) client work involves us applying this experience to help teams write better CSS—often by helping them create a design system.

You can catch up with me on [Mastodon](https://bell.bz/@andy), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/andy-set-studio) or [Github](https://github.com/Andy-set-studio). There’s [some other links here](https://andy-bell.co.uk/links/), too.
