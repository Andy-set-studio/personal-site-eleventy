# Andy’s personal site

This is my site, but I thought I'd share the code. Feel free to take what you need, **but don't rip the whole thing off because that's not cool**.

## Getting started

Ideally, you’ll be using an LTS version of Node JS and if in Windows, the WSL setup because it works better with gulp.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` to run locally
3. Run `npm run production` to do a prod build
