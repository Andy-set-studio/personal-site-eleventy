I’m a designer, front-end developer and the founder of [Set Studio](https://set.studio/).

I focus on making stunning [websites that work for everyone](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), regardless of their device or connection speed.

This is my little home on the internet where I [write](/blog/), and [collect music](/music-collection/).
