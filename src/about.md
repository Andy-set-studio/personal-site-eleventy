Hi, I’m [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/), a designer, front-end developer, [design agency founder](https://set.studio/) and the founder of [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/), based in the UK. I have worked in the design and web industries for over 15 years, and in that time, I have worked with some of the largest organisations in the world like Google, The NHS, Harley-Davidson and Oracle. I’ve also worked with well-known brands such as BSkyB, Unilever, The Natural History Museum, British Cycling, Capita, Vitality and VICE Media.

Over these years I have worked on both extremely large projects for huge organisations and tiny projects for small startups. This has given me a lot of experience of a large variety of project types. It also means I’ve worked with a lot of teams in various sizes, each with their own constraints and goals. Projects I’ve worked on vary from huge and smaller design systems, creative campaigns, complex content systems, branding and good ol’ websites.

I mostly specialise in CSS — whether that is consultancy, writing a [course for Google](https://web.dev/learn/css/), co-authoring a [book on CSS layout](https://every-layout.dev/), or creating a [methodology to help people write better CSS](https://cube.fyi/). A big chunk of [the studio’s](https://set.studio/) client work involves us applying this experience to help teams write better CSS — often by helping them create a design system.
