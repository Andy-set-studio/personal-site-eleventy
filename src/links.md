If you work for an organisation that advertises, [we offer advertising on Piccalilli too](https://piccalil.li/advertise/). The more [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/) grows into a sustainable, high quality publication, the more it helps me! It helps everyone in the community too, so you'll be doing a good thing. 

The biggest thing you can do to help though is do the best *you* can do. If my stuff helps you do that, then we're both doing well ðŸ’›
